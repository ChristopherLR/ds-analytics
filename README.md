# ds-analytics

## Dependencies
- Node, 
https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/
- Python 3, 
Note: If ```python3 --version``` does not work and ```python --version``` does, then you will need to update /routes/index.js

## Running
```bash
npm i
npm run start
```
You can then open your browser and go to the ipaddress of the device running the application **Probably localhost:3000**

## Running your own ds-client
run the parser.py in your project location and move data.json into the data directory

## Contributions
Thank you whoever it was from last year that made the parser.py, I definitely would not have been bothered to do the rest otherwise.
This was hacked together, so feel free to improve the code in any way you like!
**Help would be greatly appreciated**.
